The State Aid Decision orders Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014
"Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward"
The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and appealed to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union
Ireland has also appealed the State Aid Decision
"While the European Commission announced a recovery amount of up to€13 billion, plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by Ireland in accordance with the European Commission’s guidance"
"Once the recovery amount is computed by Ireland, the Company anticipates funding it, including interest, out of foreign cash into escrow, where it will remain pending conclusion of all appeals"
